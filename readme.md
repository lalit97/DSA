## Step: 1 (Learn a programming language)

Get comfortable with the syntax of one programming language. Python will be easy for beginners.

## Step: 2 (Practice Practice Practice!)

Beginners can start with writing scripts for simple data structures such as Array, String and Hashmaps. You can practice on [GFG](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore/?page=1) with filter Topic Tags like Arrays/Strings and set difficulty to School or Basic problems.

After getting familiar with basic data structures and problem solving. One can buy [CRACKING the CODING INTERVIEW](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) to dig deeper.

## Pattern which helped me the most

Practicing is the most important part to get better at DSA. Solving DSA questions can be related to solving Math problems in school.

Watch the solution of a problem only after giving it enough time. Also never try to memorize a solution. Instead learn the methods, techniques and train your mind to think . Try to Develop your own mental models.
